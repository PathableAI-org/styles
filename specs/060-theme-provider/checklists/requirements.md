- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- The spec relies on the existing `ThemeConfig`, `ThemeColors`, and CSS custom property mapping contracts from sibling specs (058-theme-token-types, 059-default-theme-create-theme). These are documented dependencies, not gaps.
- The `colorScheme` prop is documented as a forward-compatible hook for dark mode. This is an intentional design decision, not a missing requirement.
